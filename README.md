# Reducers

Initially introduced in Clojure, reducers are [a model for processing collections](http://clojure.com/blog/2012/05/08/reducers-a-library-and-model-for-collection-processing.html) which [transforms the procedures](http://clojure.com/blog/2012/05/15/anatomy-of-reducer.html) rather than the collections themselves.

Its advantages include lazy evaluation, few allocations, efficiency, and the potential for convenient parallelization via the closely-related *folders*.

This framework is an implementation of reducers for Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.
